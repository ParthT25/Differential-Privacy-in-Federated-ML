# Federated Learning and Differential Privacy for Health Data

This project provides a hands-on, comparative analysis of machine learning models trained on health data using both traditional centralized methods and modern privacy-preserving federated learning techniques. It uses the public Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to demonstrate and evaluate these approaches side-by-side.

The core goal is to explore the trade-offs between model performance, data privacy, and system scalability in different training regimes.

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter/Colab notebook that implements and compares several binary classification models to predict diabetes. The comparisons focus on two primary axes:
1.  **Centralized vs. Federated Training:** How does a model trained on a central server with all data present compare to a model trained in a federated setting where data remains on individual "client" devices?
2.  **Standard vs. Differentially Private Training:** What is the impact on model performance when Differential Privacy (DP) is introduced to provide formal privacy guarantees?

## Key Concepts Explored

- **Centralized Machine Learning:** The classical approach where all data is collected in one place to train a model.
- **Federated Learning (FL):** A decentralized approach where the model is trained across multiple devices (simulated clients) without exchanging the raw data, preserving user privacy. This project uses **TensorFlow Federated (TFF)**.
- **Federated Averaging (FedAvg):** The core algorithm used in this project's FL implementation, where local model updates from clients are aggregated on a central server to produce a new global model.
- **Differential Privacy (DP):** A formal, mathematical guarantee of privacy that makes it possible to learn from aggregate data while limiting what can be learned about any single individual. This is implemented using both **TensorFlow Privacy** (for centralized DP) and TFF's built-in DP aggregators.

## Models and Experiments

The notebook trains and evaluates the following logistic regression models:

1.  **Centralized `sklearn`:**
    - Trained using various classical optimizers (`liblinear`, `sag`, `lbfgs`).
    - Serves as a standard, non-deep-learning baseline.

2.  **Centralized `TensorFlow`:**
    - An equivalent logistic regression model built in Keras.
    - Trained on the complete, centralized dataset.
    - Serves as a baseline for the TensorFlow-based models.

3.  **Federated `TensorFlow Federated` (TFF):**
    - The same Keras model trained using the Federated Averaging algorithm (`FedAvg`).
    - Data is partitioned, with each data point treated as a separate client to simulate a highly distributed environment.
    - The experiment also analyzes how model performance changes with the percentage of clients participating in each training round.

4.  **Differentially Private Centralized `TensorFlow`:**
    - The centralized TF model trained with a DP-enabled optimizer from the `tensorflow_privacy` library.
    - Demonstrates the performance cost of adding DP in a centralized setting.

5.  **Differentially Private Federated `TFF`:**
    - The federated model trained using a DP-enabled aggregation mechanism (`dp_aggregator`).
    - Combines the benefits of FL and DP for the highest level of privacy.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**, a standard dataset for binary classification tasks.
- **Features (8):** Number of pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age.
- **Target (1):** Outcome (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic).

The data is preprocessed using `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` to normalize the features.

## Prerequisites

This project is designed to run in a Google Colab environment. The necessary Python libraries are installed by the notebook itself. If running locally, you will need to install the following key packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade nest_asyncio
pip install --upgrade tensorflow_privacy==0.8.6
pip install --upgrade tensorflow_federated==0.40.0
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## How to Run

1.  **Open in Google Colab:** The easiest way is to open the `.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2.  **Run All Cells:** Execute the cells sequentially from top to bottom by selecting `Runtime > Run all` from the menu.
3.  **Installation:** The initial cells will handle the installation of all required dependencies.
4.  **Execution:** The notebook will then proceed to:
    - Load and preprocess the data.
    - Train and evaluate all five model variants.
    - Generate and display the comparison plots and performance metrics.

## Expected Results and Visualizations

The notebook produces several key outputs and visualizations to help compare the different approaches:

1.  **ROC Curve Comparison:**
    A single plot showing the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores for all models. This provides a direct visual comparison of their predictive power.

2.  **AUC vs. Client Participation:**
    A line plot showing how the federated model's AUC score improves as the percentage of clients participating in each training round increases. This illustrates a key trade-off in federated systems.

3.  **Performance and Scalability Benchmarks:**
    - A **heatmap** showing the TFF training runtime as a function of both the number of clients (examples) and the number of features.
    - A **line plot** showing how runtime scales with an increasing number of clients for a fixed number of features.

*(Note: The actual plots will be generated and displayed in the notebook upon execution.)*

## Code Structure

The notebook is organized into the following logical sections:

- **Setup and Installation:** Installs TFF, TF Privacy, and other dependencies.
- **Data Initialization:** Defines functions to load the hardcoded Pima Diabetes dataset and its labels. The data is then loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and preprocessed.
- **Centralized `sklearn` Training:** Trains three `LogisticRegression` models and calculates their AUC scores.
- **Centralized `TensorFlow` Training:** Defines a Keras model for logistic regression and trains it on the full dataset.
- **Federated `TensorFlow Federated` Training:**
    - Sets up the TFF simulation environment.
    - Defines functions to create federated datasets, where each patient record is a client.
    - Builds the TFF iterative process using `build_weighted_fed_avg`.
    - Trains the model in a loop, evaluating the effect of client participation rates.
- **Federated Training with Differential Privacy:**
    - Modifies the TFF process to use a `dp_aggregator` for private model updates.
    - Re-runs the training to evaluate the performance of the private federated model.
- **Centralized Training with Differential Privacy:**
    - Implements a custom DP optimizer wrapper for a standard Keras optimizer using the `tensorflow_privacy` library.
    - Trains the centralized Keras model with DP and computes the privacy budget (epsilon).
- **Results and Visualization:**
    - Generates the comparative ROC curve plot.
    - Plots the AUC vs. participation rate for the federated model.
- **Performance Benchmarking:**
    - Contains two final sections that run synthetic benchmarks to measure how TFF training time scales with the number of clients and features.
